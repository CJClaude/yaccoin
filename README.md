Yet Another Cyber Coin
"To boldly go where so many have gone before"

Key stats:

Project started in late January, 2014.  

1024 coin initial payout - since its a power of 2, it will halve nicely! 

2 year half life - get in early.  Besides... will anyone really be wanting to mine decades from now?

23.5 years of coin generation (yields roughly 100X the 84M Litecoin limit)

1.5 minute block time - should be a decent compromise

    Short form: Faster transaction, but no so fast that stale blocks become a huge problem 
    Long form: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8972/quarkcoin-noble-intentions-wrong-approach/ 

25 hour block difficulty adjustment (every 1000 blocks)
    
Like Litecoin, YACCoin is scrypt based - a mild manored attempt at keeping it in mortal hands while still using commonly available mining tools.

Unlike Litecoin, YACCoin uses the Kimoto Gravity Well difficulty adjustment to provide some protection from difficulty surges.

Hard numbers:

8,437,616,148	Total coins in the pool

1.5 * 60 * 1000	TargetTimespan (e.g. 25 hours)

1.5 * 60	TargetSpacing (e.g. 90 seconds)

Ports:

Listen:   6333 (16333 for testnet)

JSON-RPC: 6332 (16332 for testnet)
