Yet Another Cyber Coin
"Boldly going where so many have gone before"

Key stats:

Project started in late January, 2014.  

1024 coin initial payout - since its a power of 2, it will halve nicely! 

2 year half life - get in early.  Besides... will anyone really be wanting to mine decades from now?

23.5 years of coin generation (yields roughly 100X the 84M Litecoin limit)

1.5 minute block time - should be a decent compromise

    Short form: Faster transaction, but no so fast that stale blocks become a huge problem 
    Long form: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8972/quarkcoin-noble-intentions-wrong-approach/ 

Single block difficulty adjustments - keeps it smooth (in theory), and might help prevent early spamming.
    
Like Litecoin, YACcoin is scrypt based - a mild manored attempt at keeping it in mortal hands while still using commonly available mining tools.

Hard numbers:

359,047,496	Blocks per year
718,094,991	blocks per half-life
8,437,616,148	Total blocks in the pool
1.5 * 60	TargetTimespan (e.g. 90 seconds)
1.5 * 60	TargetSpacing (e.g. 90 seconds)
