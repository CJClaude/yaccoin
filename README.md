Yet Another Cyber Coin (pronounced like the animal "yack" which it resembles in terms of usefullness)

Key stats:

Project started in late January, 2014

1024 coin initial payout - since its a power of 2, it will halve nicely! (Bitcoin and Litecoin initially paid 50)

2 year half life - get in early.  Besides... will anyone really be doing this is 6-10 years?  (vs. the common 4 year)

23.5 years of coin generation (yields roughly 100X the 84M Litecoin limit)

1.5 minute block time - should be a decent compromise

    Short form: Faster transaction, but no so fast that stale blocks become a huge problem 
    Long form: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8972/quarkcoin-noble-intentions-wrong-approach/ 
    
Like Litecoin, YACcoin is scrypt based - a mild manored attempt at keeping it in mortal hands while still using commonly available mining tools.

Hard numbers:

359,047,496	Blocks per year
718,094,991	blocks per half-life
8,437,616,148	Total blocks in the pool

Inital History
--------------

My first was centered around trying to just understand things like the relevance of block times.
I managed to hack together my first code from a Litecoin chain, but was still pretty cluelss.
This link was then followed, after which I felt a little better, but was having some issues with the code.

Finally, I started over with a new copy of the Litecoin chain for this branch.
